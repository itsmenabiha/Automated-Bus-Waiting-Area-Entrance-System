# Automated-Bus-Waiting-Area-Entrance-System
The purpose of this project is to develop an automated system to manage access to a bus waiting area, ensuring safe and controlled entry and exit of passengers.
The system uses
ultrasonic sensors to detect individuals at the entrance and exit gates, servo motors to
automate gate operations, and an LCD display to show the current number of people inside
the waiting area. This system is designed to reduce manual supervision, enhance safety, and
provide real-time monitoring of the waiting area's occupancy. The project builds on the
principles of embedded systems and automation, integrating hardware components such as
Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and an LCD. It is particularly beneficial in
limiting the number of people allowed into the waiting area at any given time, ensuring
compliance with capacity restrictions and providing a more comfortable and organized
environment for passengers. This innovation is essential for urban bus terminals, where high
foot traffic often leads to overcrowding, operational inefficiencies, and safety concerns.
